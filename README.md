## Hi, I'm Samragi Ayer 👋
I’m a cybersecurity student graduating in May 2026, building strong skills in network defense, SOC analysis, Linux, digital forensics, and incident response. Through the Google Cybersecurity Professional Certificate, I gained hands-on experience with SIEM tools, log analysis, threat detection, and security best practices.
I love solving problems, investigating threats, and understanding how systems work beneath the surface. I’m committed to growing as a cybersecurity professional and applying my skills to help organizations stay secure.
